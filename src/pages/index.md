  We meet each quarter for networking, learning - and did we mention free snacks and drinks?<br/>

  The user group is open to anyone using or considering the Sitecore Experience Platform, or who has an interest in .NET CMS platforms, regardless of technical proficiency. Programmers, marketers, content authors, CMS users and others are all welcome.<br/>

  Our events wouldn't be possible without the kind support of our Sponsors!
